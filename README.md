1. Overview

	The pulsar feature lab application is a collection of python scripts useful for
	extracting machine learning features (otherwise known as scores or variables) from
	pulsar candidate files. The code was written in order to provide a tool-kit useful
	for designing and extracting new candidate features, whilst retaining the ability to
	extract existing features developed by the community at large. This enables newly
	conceived features to be evaluated with respect to existing features allowing an
	objective decision on their utility to be reached.
	
	It is hoped this code base will be used by the radio astronomy community. By sharing
	features and the source code implementations used to extract them, existing and newly
	devised features can be evaluated together. A statistically optimal feature set can
	then be produced which maximises the performance of learning algorithms on observational
	data. This will assist all in isolating legitimate pulsar/transient/single-pulse
	detections in data collected around the world. Given the proliferation of observational
	data and the increase in data volumes to be expected from next generation radio telescopes
	such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), such collaboration is important if we are to
	avoid the `big data' problems associated with other large science projects such as the
	Atlas Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

2. Requirements

	The pulsar feature lab scripts have the following system requirements:
	
	Python 2.4 or later.
	[SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)
	[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
	[matplotlib library] (http://matplotlib.org/)
	
2. Use
	
	The application script PulsarFeatureLab.py can be executed via:
	
	<i>python PulsarFeatureLab.py</i>
	
	The script accepts a number of arguments. It requires four of these to execute, and accepts
	another three as optional.
